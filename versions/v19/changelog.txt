If you want the new features added by the "Yung's Better End Island" mod to appear ingame, you will need to reset the end island by running the following command: /end_island reset 

Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with the redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so please back up your world before trying!
If you don't want to do this, it is completely fine. Updating the modpack is still completely safe and will not damage your world, even if you do not run the command.
